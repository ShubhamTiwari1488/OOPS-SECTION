1) WAP to declare a class which stores a complex number. Include a member function which compares the modulus of the two complex class objects and returns the object with higher value. Include a parameterized constructor which arguments with same name as that of the class data members. 
2) WAP in which there is a global variable, a local variable for main function and a variable in a nested scope inside main, with the same name. Print all the three variables.
3)WAP to take input for two integer variables. Assign the value -1 to the variable with higher value using a function.
 [Use return by reference ]
4) Create a class student which stores name, date-of-birth and date-of-joining of a student. The data members date-of-birth and date-of-joining should be the objects of another class called 'date'. Input the data for 10 students and display it.
5) Write a program to demonstrate the order of call of constructors and destructors in case of multiple inheritance where one or more base classes are virtual.
